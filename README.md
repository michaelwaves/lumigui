The front end react app is in lumigui, with the welcome page in src/pages/Welcome.jsx and the main form in src/pages/One.jsx. The rest of the pages are for various other questions and checkboxes we hope to implement in the future. Custom tailwind utility classes are defined in index.css in src.

The back end is comprised of the models and routes folders and server.js in the root directory. We used an Express Server with MongoDB.

The python file that reads serial input from the Arduino is serial.ipynb, and the arduino code is lumigui.ino.
